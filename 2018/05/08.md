Last weekend was a total mess. I was getting really stressed @ work, and on the friday night a cousin of mine died, a couple of days after she had a baby. I felt I was on the edge of the abyss, so I had to step back a bit and try to focus on myself and on feeling better so I could be able to comfort my mother, who was closer to that deceased cousin than I.
