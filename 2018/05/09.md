Just got some nice feedbacks from some really cool people from a Telegram group that I'm part of. :blush:
I'm trying to get better at teaching ~ frontend things ~ to people that are starting now or people that are trying to improve some skills, and they said I should be a teacher because I'm actually pretty good at it. :confetti_ball: :tada:
In the past, I always had a really hard time when trying to explain anything to anyone, so I'm really happy to hear that. Especially because I feel that when I'm explaining things to others, that also makes me understand that thing even better, or even see something that I could've missed when I first learned that thing.

Teaching is learning. 


## ðŸ’» Code
Today I just spent some time solving exercises on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) and playing on [Untrusted](https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/) (which I highly recommend to "warm up" before coding!). Just got my new Lilypad + some light sensors and some conductive thread on the mail, hopefully I'll come up with some actual nice code to post here on the wekend.
