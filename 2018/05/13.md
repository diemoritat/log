Yesterday I went to [Front in Campinas](https://frontincampinas.com.br/), a front end event that happened on a nearby city. I'm still really tired (and a bit sick) but it was awesome. I really really like going to such events. Even though there may have talks that I don't fully understand/like or are about some specific things that I don't use, I believe it's pretty nice to see what's happening outside my "bubble" and what people are doing out there. Yesterday, specifically, the 2 talks I liked the most were about [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) and how we should think about ourselves and our skills (basically being a generalist x being a specialist). Have you ever heard about that ["broken comb people"](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2013/06/27/broken-comb-people/) metaphor? It says that you shouldn't focus on being *really* good at only one thing or being ok on lots of things. Instead, you should focus on being good on some things, being ok on others and at least know a few more. I know it's really hard to be like that, but I fully agree with this thinking. Study a lot of things, find some you like more than the others and focus yourself on being good at them.
