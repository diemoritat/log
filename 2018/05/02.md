On the last few days I was really thinking about how much of my free time I should spend on learning/improving my skills that are related to my work. I've seen lots of people discussing about it everywhere and still couldn't position myself about it... I do believe there's no easy way to be successful (whatever your position/area is) and skills are built by training but, at the same time, I think it might not be really healthy to spend so much time thinking and living for your work. I think that having other hobbies/learning about things that are totally different (like, idk, gardening, fishing, playing videogames) might be a good way to have new ideas and to come up with new solutions at work. 
Anyway, thankfully we're free to change our mind about anything anytime... right?
