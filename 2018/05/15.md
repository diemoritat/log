Quite simple scss function I'm using to remove the unit (px, em, rem) from a value. Might be useful to handle values that are being used on css rules through variables. 

```
@function strip-unit($value) {
  @if type-of($value) == 'number' and not unitless($value) {
    @return $value / ($value * 0 + 1);
  }
  @return $value;
}

$sampleVar: 25%;

@include strip-unit($sampleVar); // 25
```
